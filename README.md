Current Mission (3/19/2021): Hoping to figure out some ways to "simplify" things. Kubernetes is all-powerful but in my experience is a lot to manage (although I haven't tried out aws EKS). Curious if golang binaries + AMIs + a proxy ASG couldn't create a reliable architecture. Also starting to wonder if S3 could be better utilized/architected for data store backend uses; seems amazon is still slowly improving "performance" on s3. React is great but I've always had a pet peeve about mixing my html and my javascript syntax together.

highly experienced with:
 - core aws services (s3, iam, r53, vpc, EC2, ELB/ALB, rds, etc)
 - aws cli
 - layer 3 and up (TCP / HTTP / HTTP2)
 - docker and linux (mostly debian)
 - terraform / terraform enterprise
 - codefresh (gitops tool for builds/deployments/jobs)
 - kubectl / helm charts / harbor registry
 - gloo edge virtual services CRD
 - node js
 - basic SQL

some experience with:
  - kops (kubernetes admin)
  - golang
  - typescript
  - linkerd
  - react + redux

things I love:
  - functional programming
  - ubuntu/debian
  - vscode
  - flexibility of javascript (also wasm still seems a bit premature as of 3/19/2021)
  - performance of golang

things I tried that still aren't ready it seems:
  - golang wasm (as far as I could tell, at some point you still have to call js function names by string)
  - ubuntu as a true personal computer (steam, unreal engine, fl studio)
