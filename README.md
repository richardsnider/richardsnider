Current Mission (3/19/2021): Hoping to figure out some ways to "simplify" things. Kubernetes is all-powerful but in my experience is a lot to manage (although I haven't tried out aws EKS). Curious if golang binaries + AMIs + a proxy ASG couldn't create a reliable architecture. Also starting to wonder if S3 could be better utilized/architected for data store backend uses; seems amazon is still slowly improving "performance" on s3. React is great but I've always had a pet peeve about mixing my html and my javascript syntax together.

highly experienced with:
 - aws cli with core services (s3, iam, r53, vpc, EC2, ELB/ALB, rds, etc)
 - linux (mostly debian), docker, kubectl, helm charts, codefresh (CI/CD tool)
 - layer 3 and up (TCP / HTTP / HTTP2)
 - terraform / terraform enterprise
 - gloo edge virtual services CRD
 - node js
 - parameterized SQL queries

some experience with:
  - kubernetes cluster administration, kops
  - golang
  - typescript + react + redux
  - linkerd service mesh
  - okta + saml

things I love:
  - functional programming with javascript and golang
  - ubuntu/debian
  - vscode
